🧠 SkillCheck – AI-Powered Learning, Simplified

💡 Inspiration

As students, we know the struggle of preparing for exams, mastering new concepts, and staying on top of coursework. With AI becoming more powerful, we wanted to build something that could make learning easier, personalized, and interactive. That’s how SkillCheck was born—a platform that helps students sharpen their skills through AI-generated practice questions, instant feedback, and gamified learning experiences.

Our goal? To make studying smarter, not harder.

🛠️ What it does and how we built it

SkilICheck is a web-based platform that generates personalized practice questions and interactive challenges based on the user’s chosen subject and difficulty level. The core of our project revolves around Hugging Face AI models, which help in generating dynamic quiz questions and explanations.

We originally planned to integrate Azure Cognitive Services for Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT) to make learning even more accessible, allowing users to interact with the platform through voice. However, we ran into roadblocks while implementing these features. Despite that, we successfully built a robust AI-driven quiz generator with an intuitive UI that adapts to the user’s learning pace.

Technologies Used

TECHNOLOGY	HOW IT WAS USED
React.js	For building the interactive front-end
Python (Flask)	Backend framework for API handling
Hugging Face API	For AI-generated quiz questions and explanations
Azure Cognitive Services (Planned)	TTS and STT features for accessibility (partially integrated)
🚧 Challenges we ran into and what we learned

We faced several hurdles throughout the development process, including:

🔹 AI integration – None of us had prior experience working with AI models, so we had to learn from scratch, experiment, and tweak our prompts to get relevant results.
🔹 Azure Cognitive Services – Implementing Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text was more complex than expected, and we couldn't fully integrate it in time.
🔹 Animated Badges – Creating and displaying dynamic progress badges turned out to be trickier than anticipated. We had to troubleshoot API requests and adjust our front-end logic multiple times.
Through these challenges, we gained hands-on experience with AI development, learned how to troubleshoot API integration issues, and most importantly, became better at working as a team under pressure.

🏆 Accomplishments we’re proud of

✨ Successfully implemented AI-powered quiz generation
✨ Built an interactive web app with real-time feedback
✨ Gained a deeper understanding of AI and machine learning
✨ Laid the groundwork for future accessibility features (TTS & STT)

Most importantly, we created something that can genuinely help students study smarter, stay motivated, and track their progress in a fun and interactive way.

🚀 What’s next for SkillCheck?

We’re excited to continue improving SkillCheck with:

🔹 Full Azure Cognitive Services integration – Making voice-based interactions seamless.
🔹 Expanding subject coverage – Adding support for more disciplines beyond CS.
🔹 Better gamification – More achievements, competitive challenges, and progress tracking.
🔹 Collaboration features – Letting users challenge friends or form study groups in real time.
This project was just the beginning—we’re looking forward to taking SkillCheck even further! 🚀🎉
